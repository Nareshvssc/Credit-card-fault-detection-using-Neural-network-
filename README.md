Handling Imbalance data using tensorflow 
Following Points were covered in this 
  1. How does the influence of initial weights in neural network affect the results 
  2. Which parameter is more important while deciding the threshold , this problem is a case of imbalance data tho we get accuracy of 99% ,but still false negative were high
  3. How to reduce the false negative 
  4. How does AUCROC curve is drawn and infered 
  5. How to infer the confusion matrix
